## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project had some challenging aspects in terms of layout switch from desktop to mobile versions, I continued to learn more about CSS properties and how they beahve in different settings especially the overflow property and setting background image on the body without it spilling/overflowing the entire Html document. 

Learnt how to create a slider using CSS which was quite interesting and challenging at the same time.
